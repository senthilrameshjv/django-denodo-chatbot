What is the Database URI to use to connect to Denodo Platform?
This is the JDBC URI you can use - jdbc:vdb://<hostName>:<port>/<databaseName>[?<paramName>=<paramValue> [&<paramName>=<paramValue>]* ]
What is the Database URI to use to connect to Virtual DataPort server?
JDBC connections can use this URI - jdbc:vdb://<hostName>:<port>/<databaseName>[?<paramName>=<paramValue> [&<paramName>=<paramValue>]* ]
Where can I find the drivers to connect to Virtual DataPort or Denodo Platform?
The client drivers to connect to Virtual DataPort through JDBC and ODBC are available under the folder <DENODO_HOME>/tools/client-drivers
Thanks
You are welcome
